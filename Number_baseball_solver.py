# In 100,000 simulations (no repetitive candidates), the entropy version required on average approximately 0.01 fewer turns than the naive Bayesian (light) version.
# In smaller simulations (1,000–10,000 trials), the maximum observed difference was 2 turns, with an average gap of about 0.6 turns.
# Adding heuristics(like fixed approximation for 3 turns) makes entropy-based solver faster
# 0.x secs difference between two versions in this version(originally, the time difference was much larger)(in no repetitive candidates)
# Therefore, the faster (or light) version is effectively a legacy version, but it has been deliberately retained for its probabilistic approach, which allows it to reach results more quickly (naive Bayesian).
# it takes about half the time of the entropy-based version, but requires one turn more on average.(in repetitive candidates)
# In the end, the performance of the two versions is almost similar.

"""
Overall, while the entropy-based solver can be considered the more principled and theoretically optimal approach, 
large-scale validation (100,000 trials) shows that its advantage over the naive Bayesian (light) solver is practically negligible (≈0.01 turns on average).
In contrast, the Bayesian solver consistently runs faster, often by a factor of two, and thus remains a valid and efficient alternative.
In short, the entropy version represents methodological refinement, whereas the Bayesian version represents pragmatic efficiency; both remain competitive depending on whether accuracy or speed is prioritized.
